This repository contains information about **OrchidSunroom**, an Android Material design app I am currently designing and implementing in Kotlin to help professional and amateur Orchid growers and enthusiasts catalog and manage their collections.

# About Orchid Sunroom

# Beta Testers Needed!!


Before release to the general public on the Play Store all apps undergo a beta testing phase. I am currently seeking beta testers to try out Orchid Sunroom and report usability issues and bugs. Beta testing will involve downloading the app from the Play Store (it will be restricted to testers only) and testing it out on a small subset of your collection. I am committed to providing a feature to reliably back up and restore your collection. However, during the testing phase it is entirely possible that when you install a newer version you will lose all the data you entered previously. **And, of course, Beta testers will receive the app and all future updates for free.**

**The app is in active development and will undergo frequent bug fixes, changes and improvements. Please contact me with questions, comments, or if you are interested in a particular feature.**


# Screenshots (click images to enlarge)

**These are only some of the screens from the app. Coming soon: screenshots of the Image Gallery, detailed views of adding and editing orchids, setting up schedules, and more!**


## Orchids Tab

This screen screen displays your entire catalog in an endless scrolling list. Clicking on an orchid opens a separate screen where you can edit your orchid and set up its watering and fertilizing schedules.
	
Currently the Orchid screen has only one format option. Future versions will include additional formats for displaying your orchids including but not limited to as a list, as a grid with smaller icons, and will offer filter and search features.

# About Me

I've been a professional Android app developer for 10 years and I can say from experience that developing a full-featured, user-friendly mobile app requires an enormous investment of time and expertise! I began writing this app in 2018 and have continued to develop it as my schedule has permitted. Over the past five years I've written lots of other apps for my jobs and seen Google make numerous major changes the Android development platform. prompting me to completely redesign and rewrite this one several times.
