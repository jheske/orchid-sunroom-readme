This repository contains information about **Orchid Sunroom**, an app I am currently designing and implementing in FLUTTER to help professional and amateur Orchid growers and enthusiasts catalog and manage their collections. This app is currently targetted to run on both iOS and ANDROID devices. Future plans include Desktop and Web versions.

# About Orchid Sunroom

# Beta Testers Needed!!


Before release to the general public on the Play Store all apps undergo a beta testing phase. I am currently seeking beta testers to try out Orchid Sunroom and report usability issues and bugs. Beta testing will involve downloading the app from the Play Store (it will be restricted to testers only) and testing it out on a small subset of your collection. I am committed to providing a feature to reliably back up and restore your collection. However, during the testing phase it is entirely possible that when you install a newer version you will lose all the data you entered previously. **And, of course, Beta testers will receive the app and all future updates for free.**


**Orchid Sunroom is in active development and will undergo frequent bug fixes, changes and improvements. Please contact me with questions, comments, or if you are interested in a particular feature.**

# Future Plans

Here are just a few ideas for future features. Feel free to contact me with your favorite ideas!

* Show more orchid details like parentage and awards
* Search and sort your collection in lots of different ways
* Share links to email and social media
* Email or text alerts for scheduled events
* Barcodes for each orchid
* Integrate environmental sensors
* Create merchandise like T-shirts and greeting cards featuring your orchids


# Features (click images to enlarge)

**This section includes only some of the screens from the app. There are lots more!**

## Orchids Screen

Displays your entire catalog in an endless scrolling list. Clicking on an orchid opens a separate screen where you can edit your orchid and set up its watering and fertilizing schedules. You also use this screen to add new orchids to your collection.
	
Currently the Orchid screen has only one format option. Future versions will include additional formats for displaying your orchids including but not limited to as a list, as a grid with smaller icons, and will offer filter and search features.

### Add an Orchid

You can add as many orchids as you like to your collection. Each orchid has its own gallery of images and its own journal to keep track of important events like last bloom, new roots, water, and fertilizer.

### Orchid Details

Here you can edit most of the details for your orchid. The app will use the information you provide on this screen to help you search and sort your collection. It also facilitates showing reminders and icons for watering, repotting, and fertilizing schedules.

# About Me

I've been a professional Android app developer for 10 years and I can say from experience that developing a full-featured, user-friendly mobile app requires an enormous investment of time and expertise! I began writing this app in 2018 and have continued to develop it as my schedule has permitted. Over the past five years I've written lots of other apps for my jobs and seen Google make numerous major changes the Android development platform, prompting me to completely redesign and rewrite Orchid Sunroom several times. 

# Tech Stuff
