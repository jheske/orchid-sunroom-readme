## Synopsis

 ![OrchidSunroom icon](https://github.com/jheske/orchid-sunroom/blob/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png?raw=true)

This repository contains information about **OrchidSunroom**, an Android Material design app I am currently designing and implementing in Kotlin to help professional and amateur Orchid growers and enthusiasts catalog and manage their collections.

**This app is in active development and will undergo frequent bug fixes, changes and improvements. Please contact developer with questions, comments, or if you are interested in a particular feature.**

## Overview

The app comprises 4 main screens:

### Orchids

This is the Home screen that displays your entire catalog in an endless scrolling list. Clicking on an orchid opens a separate screen where you can edit your orchid and set up its watering and fertilizing schedules.
	
Currently the Orchid screen has only one format option. Future versions will include additional formats for displaying your orchids including but not limited to as a list, as a grid with smaller icons, and will offer filter and search features.

### Today

This screen facilitates your daily review of you collection. It allows you to add checkmarks to orchids as you water and fertilize them. It displays icons on orchids that are scheduled for water or fertilizer. 

The Today screen also has quick links to your orchid's Details, Photo Gallery and Journal. 

### Journal

The Journal show your collection with a chronological list of events in each orchid's life and care, including when it was added to your collection, was watered, bloomed, etc.  

### More

The More screen contains a menu of additional features. The only available option so far is screen with a searchable list of all orchid genera.
